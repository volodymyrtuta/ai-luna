# ✨ AI Luna ✨


`ChatterBot / GPT / Claude / langchain local or cloud / chatglm / text-generation-webui / iFlytek Spark / Zhipu AI`

As a `Brain` driven virtual anchor `Live2D / Vtube Studio / UE5 + Audio2Face`, you can interact with the audience in real time during the `Bilibili / Douyin / Kuaishou / Douyu` live broadcast or chat with you directly locally

It uses natural language processing and text-to-speech technology `Edge-TTS / VITS-Fast / elevenlabs / bark-gui / VALL-E-X` to generate responses to audience questions and can be voice-changed via `so-vits-svc / DDSP-SVC`

In addition, you can also use specific instructions to collaborate with `Stable Diffusion` for drawing display. And you can customize the copy for loop playback
